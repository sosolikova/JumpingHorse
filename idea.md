The game is inspired by Google Chrome T-Rex Style. 

MAIN IDEA:
The main character of the game is a horse that runs through the countryside and jumps over the obstacles placed on its path.
Once the game starts, a timer is started to record the duration of the game. If the horse hits an obstacle, the game is stopped and the score is entered in the High Score field. 
The highest score achieved is always recorded in this field.

GAME CONTROLS:
The game is started by pressing the space bar. One of the obstacles is a flying sparrow, which can also be avoided by lowering the horse. 
Lowering the horse is done by pressing the down arrow.

GAME DIFFICULTY:
The game speeds up according to the timer. 
According to the timer, the number of obstacles placed on the position is also multiplied. 
After a certain time, a sparrow starts flying in the opposite direction, which you also need to avoid.

GAME OVER:
The game ends immediately after contact with an obstacle.
